        Hi 👋, 🎓 I’m a First-Class Mathematics graduate (CGPA 4.85) from the
        University of Benin, with a passion for logic and problem-solving. My
        love for math began early, winning a 🏆 national competition in high
        school.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        💻 I transitioned into full-stack development, earning Coursera
        certifications and building real-world projects—like a Bolt-style ride
        app 🚗, an admin dashboard, and a web scraping tool for a company.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        🧠 I specialize in scalable backend APIs using Django, Flask, Express,
        and Next.js, with tools like DRF, PostGIS, and WebSockets. I’ve built
        systems with authentication, real-time chat, map-based matching, and
        multi-role access. On the frontend, I use React ⚛️ to create clean,
        responsive UIs.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        📚 I’m driven by daily learning, especially where Math, Machine
        Learning, and Software Engineering intersect. I value clean, efficient,
        and impactful code.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5">
        🎨 Outside tech, I enjoy singing 🎤, drawing ✍️, and solving puzzles
        🧩—they keep my mind sharp and creative.
